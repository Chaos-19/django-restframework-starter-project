1 .change HttpResponse and JsonResponse response to restframwork  Response object, which is a type of TemplateResponse that takes unrendered content and uses content negotiation to determine the correct content type to return to the client.

2. REST framework provides two wrappers you can use to write API views.

The @api_view decorator for working with function based views.
The APIView class for working with class-based views.

These wrappers provide a few bits of functionality such as 
making sure you receive Request instances in your view, and adding 
context to Response objects so that content negotiation can be 
performed.

The wrappers also provide behavior such as returning 405 Method 
Not Allowed  responses when appropriate, and handling any 
ParseErrorexceptions that occur when accessing request.data with 
malformed input.

## in tutorial-2 we use function base rest wrapper 

3 format suffixes of URLs is used to determine the response type when it spacified in url
